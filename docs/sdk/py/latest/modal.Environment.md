# modal.Environment

```
class Environment(modal.object.Object)
```

 

## hydrateÂ

```
hydrate(self, client=None)
```

Synchronize the local object with its identity on the Modal server.

It is rarely necessary to call this method explicitly, as most operations
will lazily hydrate when needed. The main use case is when you need to
access object metadata, such as its ID.

*Added in v0.72.39*: This method replaces the deprecated `.resolve()` method.

## nameÂ

```
name(self)
```

 

## objectsÂ

```
objects: EnvironmentManager
```

Namespace with methods for managing Environment objects.

### objects.createÂ

```
create(self, name, *, restricted=False, client=None)
```

Create a new Environment.

**Examples:**

```
modal.Environment.objects.create("my-environment")
```

 

### objects.listÂ

```
list(self, *, client=None)
```

Return a list of hydrated Environment objects.

**Examples:**

```
environments = modal.Environment.objects.list()
print([e.name for e in environments])
```

 

### objects.deleteÂ

```
delete(self, name, *, client=None)
```

Delete a named Environment.

Warning: This is irreversible and will transitively delete all objects in the Environment.

**Examples:**

```
modal.Environment.objects.delete("my-environment")
```

 

## membersÂ

```
members: EnvironmentMembersManager
```

Namespace with methods for managing the membership of a restricted Environment.

See <https://modal.com/docs/guide/rbac> for more information on restricted Environments.

### members.listÂ

```
list(self)
```

Return the members of a restricted Environment with their roles.

**Examples:**

```
members = modal.Environment.from_name("my-restricted-env").members.list()
print(members)
# {
#     "users": {"alice": "contributor", "bob": "viewer"},
#     "service_users": {"alice-bot": "contributor"},
# }
```

 

### members.updateÂ

```
update(self, *, users=None, service_users=None)
```

Add or modify roles for members of a restricted Environment.

Each user or service user will be added to the Environment if not currently a member;
if already a member, the user or service userâs role will be updated.

**Examples:**

```
env = modal.Environment.from_name("my-restricted-env")
env.members.update(
    users={"alice": "contributor", "bob": "viewer"},
    service_users={"alice-bot": "contributor"},
)
```

 

### members.removeÂ

```
remove(self, *, users=None, service_users=None)
```

Remove members from a restricted Environment.

**Examples:**

```
env = modal.Environment.from_name("my-restricted-env")
env.members.remove(
    users=["alice"],
    service_users=["alice-bot"],
)
```

 

## from\_contextÂ

```
from_context(*, client=None)
```

Look up an Environment object using the current context.

This method returns the Environment that is defined by the local configuration
(i.e., your active profile or the `MODAL_ENVIRONMENT` environment variable), or
it fetches the default environment from the server when not defined locally.
If called inside a Modal container, it will return the Environment that container
is associated with.

## from\_nameÂ

```
from_name(name, *, create_if_missing=False, client=None)
```

Look up an Environment object using its name.

## billingÂ

```
billing: EnvironmentBillingManager
```

Namespace for Environment billing APIs

```
__init__(self, environment)
```

mdmd:ignore

### billing.reportÂ

```
report(self, *, start, end=None, resolution="d", tag_names=None)
```

Return a cost report for Environment usage, broken down by object and time.

**Parameters**

start datetime

Start of the report, inclusive and rounded to the beginning of the interval. Must be in UTC or timezone-naive (interpreted as UTC).

end datetime | None

End of the report, exclusive. Must be in UTC or timezone-naive. Partial final intervals will be excluded from the report.

resolution str

Resolution, e.g. "d" for daily or "h" for hourly. (Default is "d")

tag\_names list[str] | None

List of tag names; each row will include the tag name and value in use for that object during the relevant time interval. Pass `["*"]` to include all tags in the report.

**Returns**

A list of `BillingReportItem` dataclasses. Each item reports the cost attributed to
a specific Modal object during a given time interval. Cost is further broken down by
the resource type that generated it (e.g. CPU, Memory, specific GPU usage).
Note that the specific resource types included in the breakdown are subject to change
as Modalâs billing model evolves.
