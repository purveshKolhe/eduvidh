# modal.Sandbox

```
class Sandbox(modal.object.Object)
```

A `Sandbox` object lets you interact with a running sandbox. This API is similar to Pythonâs [asyncio.subprocess.Process](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-subprocess.html#asyncio.subprocess.Process).

Refer to the [guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/sandbox) on how to spawn and use sandboxes.

## hydrateÂ

```
hydrate(self, client=None)
```

Synchronize the local object with its identity on the Modal server.

It is rarely necessary to call this method explicitly, as most operations
will lazily hydrate when needed. The main use case is when you need to
access object metadata, such as its ID.

*Added in v0.72.39*: This method replaces the deprecated `.resolve()` method.

## createÂ

```
create(*args, app=None, name=None, tags=None, image=None, env=None,
    secrets=None, network_file_systems={}, timeout=300, idle_timeout=None,

any operation using the Sandbox object is not guaranteed to work anymore. If you want to continue interacting
with a running sandbox, use `Sandbox.from_id` to get a new Sandbox object.

## from\_nameÂ

```
from_name(app_name, name, *, environment_name=None, client=None)
```

Get a running Sandbox by name from a deployed App.

**Raises**

* `NotFoundError`: If no running sandbox exists with the given name.

## from\_idÂ

```
from_id(sandbox_id, client=None)
```

**Returns**

Tags as a map from tag name to tag value.

## set\_tagsÂ

```
set_tags(self, tags, *, client=None)
```

**Parameters**

tags dict[str, str]

Tag names and values to set on this sandbox.

client \_Client | None

Deprecated. Prefer setting the client when creating or re-attaching to the sandbox.

Sandbox with the same filesystem.

## mount\_imageÂ

```
mount_image(self, path, image, *, _experimental_encryption_key=None)
```

Mount an Image at a specified path in a running Sandbox.

`path` should be a directory that is **not** the root path (`/`). If the path doesnât exist
it will be created. If it exists and contains data, the previous directory will be replaced
by the mount.

The `image` argument supports any Image that has an object ID, including:

* Images built using `image.build()`
* Images referenced by ID, e.g. `Image.from_id(...)`
* Filesystem/directory snapshots, e.g. created by `.snapshot_directory()` or `.snapshot_filesystem()`
* Empty images created with `Image.from_scratch()`

**Parameters**

path PurePosixPath | str

Absolute mount point directory inside the sandbox (not `/`).

image \_Image

Image to mount at `path` (must be built, referenced by ID, or snapshot-based as described above).

**Usage**

sandbox_session_2.filesystem.list_files("/user_project")
```

 

## unmount\_imageÂ

```
unmount_image(self, path)
```

`ttl` The resulting Image is retained for `ttl` seconds (default: 30 days)
Pass `ttl=None` to retain the image indefinitely.

**Parameters**

path PurePosixPath | str

Absolute path of the directory inside the sandbox to snapshot.

**Returns**

An `Image` containing the directory contents.

```

Remove a file or directory in the Sandbox.

When `remote_path` is a directory and `recursive` is `False` (the
default), removes it only if it is empty. When `recursive` is `True`,
removes the directory and all its contents.

Recursive directory removal is not supported on all mounts.
In particular, `CloudBucketMount` does not support it. An `InvalidError` is raised in that case.

**Parameters**

remote\_path str

Absolute path to the file in the Sandbox.

recursive bool

When `True`, remove the directory and all its contents. (Default is False)

**Raises**

* `SandboxFilesystemNotFoundError`: The remote path does not exist.
* `SandboxFilesystemDirectoryNotEmptyError`: `recursive` is `False` and the directory is not empty.
* `SandboxFilesystemPermissionError`: Read permission is denied in the Sandbox.
* `InvalidError`: The operation is not supported by the mount.

```

 

### filesystem.statÂ

```
stat(self, remote_path)
```

Return metadata for a single file, directory, or symlink in the Sandbox.

`remote_path` must be an absolute path in the Sandbox. If `remote_path` is a symlink, the returned `FileInfo` object describes the symlink, not the target it points to.

* `SandboxFilesystemNotADirectoryError`: a non-leaf component of the path is not a directory.
* `SandboxFilesystemPermissionError`: a component of the path is not searchable.
* `SandboxFilesystemError`: the command fails for any other reason.

**Usage**

```
sandbox.filesystem.write_text("Hello, world!\n", "/tmp/hello.txt")
info = sandbox.filesystem.stat("/tmp/hello.txt")
print(info.size, info.permissions, info.modified_time)
```

 

### filesystem.watchÂ

```
watch(self, remote_path, *, filter=None, recursive=False, timeout=None)
```

Watch a path in the Sandbox for filesystem changes.

`remote_path` must be an absolute path in the Sandbox. If it points
to a file, events for that file are reported. If it points to a
directory, events for entries directly inside it are reported. Set `recursive=True` to also receive events for all nested subdirectories.
If `remote_path` is a symlink, it is followed and events reference
paths under the resolved target.

Yields `FileWatchEvent` objects as changes occur, until either `timeout` seconds elapse, the iterator is closed, or the Sandbox
is terminated.

Optionally restrict the kinds of events emitted to those included
in `filter`. The default filter `None` permits all event types.

`timeout` is in seconds. `None` means watch indefinitely. When `timeout` elapses, the iterator stops without raising an exception.

**Raises**

* `SandboxFilesystemNotFoundError`: `remote_path` does not exist.
* `SandboxFilesystemPermissionError`: watch access is denied.
* `InvalidError`: the filesystem at `remote_path` does not support
  watching.
* `SandboxFilesystemError`: the command fails for any other reason.

**Usage**

```
for event in sandbox.filesystem.watch(
    "/tmp/foo",
    recursive=True,
    filter=[FileWatchEventType.Create],
    timeout=60,
):
    if any(p.endswith(".done") for p in event.paths):
        break
```

## lsÂ

```
ls(self, path)
```

[Alpha] List the contents of a directory in the Sandbox.

**Deprecated (2026-04-15):** Use `Sandbox.filesystem.list_files()` instead for improved reliability.

**Parameters**

path str

Absolute directory path inside the sandbox.

**Returns**

Entry names in the directory as a list of strings.

## mkdirÂ

```
mkdir(self, path, parents=False)
```

[Alpha] Create a new directory in the Sandbox.

**Deprecated (2026-04-15):** Use `Sandbox.filesystem.make_directory()` instead for improved reliability.

## rmÂ

```
rm(self, path, recursive=False)
```

[Alpha] Remove a file or directory in the Sandbox.

**Deprecated (2026-04-15):** Use `Sandbox.filesystem.remove()` instead for improved reliability.

## watchÂ

```
watch(self, path, filter=None, recursive=None, timeout=None)
```

[Alpha] Watch a file or directory in the Sandbox for changes.

**Deprecated (2026-05-08):** Use `Sandbox.filesystem.watch()` instead for improved reliability.

**Parameters**

path str

Absolute path to watch.

filter builtins.list[FileWatchEventType] | None

Optional list of event types to include.

recursive bool | None

Whether to watch subdirectories; None uses server defaults.

timeout int | None

Optional timeout for the watch stream.

**Returns**

An async iterator of `FileWatchEvent` values.

## stdoutÂ

```
stdout(self)
```

**Returns**

Stream reader for sandbox stdout.

## stderrÂ

```
stderr(self)
```

[`StreamReader`](https://modal.com/docs/sdk/py/latest/modal.io_streams#modalio_streamsstreamreader) for the Sandboxâs stderr stream.

**Returns**

Stream reader for sandbox stderr.

## stdinÂ

```
stdin(self)
```

**Returns**

Exit code when the sandbox process has completed, otherwise None.

## listÂ

```
list(*, app_id=None, tags=None, client=None)
```

Sandboxes that have at least those tags are returned.

**Parameters**

app\_id str | None

If set, restrict results to sandboxes under this app ID.

tags dict[str, str] | None

If set, only sandboxes containing at least these tags are returned.

client \_Client | None

Modal client to use for listing; defaults to `Client.from_env()` when omitted.
