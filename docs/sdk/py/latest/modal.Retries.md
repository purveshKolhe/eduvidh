# modal.Retries

```
class Retries(object)
```

Adds a retry policy to a Modal function.

**Usage**

```
import modal
app = modal.App()

# Basic configuration.
# This sets a policy of max 4 retries with 1-second delay between failures.
@app.function(retries=4)
def f():
    pass

# Fixed-interval retries with 3-second delay between failures.
@app.function(
    retries=modal.Retries(
        max_retries=2,
        backoff_coefficient=1.0,
        initial_delay=3.0,
    )
)
def g():
    pass

# Exponential backoff, with retry delay doubling after each failure.
@app.function(
    retries=modal.Retries(
        max_retries=4,
        backoff_coefficient=2.0,
        initial_delay=1.0,
    )
)
def h():
    pass
```

```
__init__(self, *, max_retries, backoff_coefficient=2.0, initial_delay=1.0,
    max_delay=60.0)
```

Construct a new retries policy, supporting exponential and fixed-interval delays via a backoff coefficient.

**Parameters**

max\_retries int

Maximum number of retries after failures.

backoff\_coefficient float

Multiplier applied to the delay after each attempt; `1.0` means fixed delay. (Default is 2.0)

initial\_delay float

Seconds before the first retry. (Default is 1.0)

max\_delay float

Upper cap on the delay between retries (seconds). (Default is 60.0)
