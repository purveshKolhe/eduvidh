# Run cron jobs in the cloud to search Hacker News

In this example, we use Modal to deploy a cron job that periodically queries Hacker News for
new posts matching a given search term, and posts the results to Slack.

## Import and define the appÂ

Letâs start off with imports, and defining a Modal app.

```
import os
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

import modal

app = modal.App("example-hackernews-alerts")
```

Now, letâs define an image that has the `slack-sdk` package installed, in which we can run a function
that posts a slack message.

```
slack_sdk_image = modal.Image.debian_slim().uv_pip_install("slack-sdk")
```

 

## Defining the function and importing the secretÂ

Our Slack bot will need access to a bot token.
We can use Modalâs [Secrets](https://modal.com/secrets) interface to accomplish this.
To quickly create a Slack bot secret, click the âCreate new secretâ button.
Then, select the Slack secret template from the list options,
and follow the instructions in the âWhere to find the credentials?â panel.
Name your secret `hn-bot-slack.`

Now, we define the function `post_to_slack`, which simply instantiates the Slack client using our token,
and then uses it to post a message to a given channel name.

```
@app.function(
    image=slack_sdk_image,
    secrets=[modal.Secret.from_name("hn-bot-slack", required_keys=["SLACK_BOT_TOKEN"])],
)
async def post_to_slack(message: str):
    import slack_sdk

    client = slack_sdk.WebClient(token=os.environ["SLACK_BOT_TOKEN"])
    client.chat_postMessage(channel="hn-alerts", text=message)
```

 

## Searching Hacker NewsÂ

We are going to use Algoliaâs [Hacker News Search API](https://hn.algolia.com/api) to query for posts
matching a given search term in the past X days. Letâs define our search term and query period.

```
QUERY = "serverless"
WINDOW_SIZE_DAYS = 1
```

Letâs also define an image that has the `requests` package installed, so we can query the API.

```
requests_image = modal.Image.debian_slim().uv_pip_install("requests")
```

We can now define our main entrypoint, that queries Algolia for the term, and calls `post_to_slack` on all the results. We specify a [schedule](https://modal.com/docs/guide/cron) in the function decorator, which means that our function will run automatically at the given interval.

```
@app.function(image=requests_image)
def search_hackernews():
    import requests

    url = "http://hn.algolia.com/api/v1/search"

    threshold = datetime.utcnow() - timedelta(days=WINDOW_SIZE_DAYS)

    params = {
        "query": QUERY,
        "numericFilters": f"created_at_i>{threshold.timestamp()}",
    }

    response = requests.get(url, params, timeout=10).json()
    urls = [item["url"] for item in response["hits"] if item.get("url")]

    print(f"Query returned {len(urls)} items.")

    post_to_slack.for_each(urls)
```

 

## Test runningÂ

We can now test run our scheduled function as follows: `modal run hackernews_alerts.py::app.search_hackernews`

## Defining the schedule and deployingÂ

Letâs define a function that will be called by Modal every day

```
@app.function(schedule=modal.Period(days=1))
def run_daily():
    search_hackernews.remote()
```

In order to deploy this as a persistent cron job, you can run `modal deploy hackernews_alerts.py`,

Once the job is deployed, visit the [apps page](https://modal.com/apps) page to see
its execution history, logs and other stats.
