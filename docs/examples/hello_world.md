# Hello, world!

This tutorial demonstrates some core features of Modal:

* You can run functions on Modal just as easily as you run them locally.
* Running functions in parallel on Modal is simple and fast.
* Logs and errors show up immediately, even for functions running on Modal.

## Importing Modal and setting upÂ

We start by importing `modal` and creating a `App`.
We build up this `App` to [define our application](https://modal.com/docs/guide/apps).

```
import sys

import modal

app = modal.App("example-hello-world")
```

 

## Defining a functionÂ

Modal takes code and runs it in the cloud.

So first weâve got to write some code.

Letâs write a simple function that takes in an input,
prints a log or an error to the console,
and then returns an output.

To make this function work with Modal, we just wrap it in a decorator, [`@app.function`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App#function).

```
@app.function()
def f(i):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print("hello", i)
    else:
        print("world", i, file=sys.stderr)

    return i * i
```

 

## Running our function locally, remotely, and in parallelÂ

Now letâs see three different ways we can call that function:

1. As a regular call on your `local` machine, with `f.local`
2. As a `remote` call that runs in the cloud, with `f.remote`
3. By `map`ping many copies of `f` in the cloud over many inputs, with `f.map`

We call `f` in each of these ways inside the `main` function below.

```
@app.local_entrypoint()
def main():
    # run the function locally
    print(f.local(1000))

    # run the function remotely on Modal
    print(f.remote(1000))

    # run the function in parallel and remotely on Modal
    total = 0
    for ret in f.map(range(200)):
        total += ret

    print(total)
```

Enter `modal run hello_world.py` in a shell, and youâll see a Modal app initialize.
Youâll then see the `print`ed logs of
the `main` function and, mixed in with them, all the logs of `f` as it is run
locally, then remotely, and then remotely and in parallel.

Thatâs all triggered by adding the [`@app.local_entrypoint`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.App#local_entrypoint) decorator on `main`, which defines it as the function to start from locally when we invoke `modal run`.

## What just happened?Â

When we called `.remote` on `f`, the function was executed *in the cloud*, on Modalâs infrastructure, not on the local machine.

In short, we took the function `f`, put it inside a container,
sent it the inputs, and streamed back the logs and outputs.

## But why does this matter?Â

Try one of these things next to start seeing the full power of Modal!

### You can change the code and run it againÂ

For instance, change the `print` statement in the function `f` to print `"spam"` and `"eggs"` instead and run the app again.
Youâll see that that your new code is run with no extra work from you â
and it should even run faster!

Modalâs goal is to make running code in the cloud feel like youâre
running code locally. That means no waiting for long image builds when youâve just moved a comma,
no fiddling with container image pushes, and no context-switching to a web UI to inspect logs.

### You can map over more dataÂ

Change the `map` range from `200` to some large number, like `1170`. Youâll see
Modal create and run even more containers in parallel this time.

And itâll happen lightning fast!

### You can run a more interesting functionÂ

The function `f` is a bit silly and doesnât do much, but in its place
imagine something that matters to you, like:

* Running [language model inference](https://modal.com/docs/examples/vllm_inference) or [fine-tuning](https://modal.com/docs/examples/slack-finetune)
* Manipulating [audio](https://modal.com/docs/examples/musicgen) or [images](https://modal.com/docs/examples/diffusers_lora_finetune)
* [Embedding huge text datasets](https://modal.com/docs/examples/amazon_embeddings) at lightning fast speeds

Modal lets you parallelize that operation effortlessly by running hundreds or
thousands of containers in the cloud.
