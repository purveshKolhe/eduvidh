# Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for question-answering with LangChain

In this example we create a large-language-model (LLM) powered question answering
Web Function and CLI. Only a single document is used as the knowledge-base of the application,
the 2022 USA State of the Union address by President Joe Biden. However, this same application structure
could be extended to do question-answering over all State of the Union speeches, or other large text corpuses.

Itâs the [LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) library that makes this all so easy.
This demo is only around 100 lines of code!

## Defining dependenciesÂ

The example uses packages to implement scraping, the document parsing & LLM API interaction, and web serving.
These are installed into a Debian Slim base image using the `uv_pip_install` method.

Because OpenAIâs API is used, we also specify the `openai-secret` Modal Secret, which contains an OpenAI API key.

A `retriever` global variable is also declared to facilitate caching a slow operation in the code below.

```
from pathlib import Path

import modal

image = modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.11").uv_pip_install(
    # scraping pkgs
    "beautifulsoup4~=4.11.1",
    "httpx==0.23.3",
    "lxml~=4.9.2",
    # llm pkgs
    "faiss-cpu~=1.7.3",
    "langchain==0.3.7",
    "langchain-community==0.3.7",
    "langchain-openai==0.2.9",
    "openai~=1.54.0",
    "tiktoken==0.8.0",
    # web app packages
    "fastapi[standard]==0.115.4",
    "pydantic==2.9.2",
    "starlette==0.41.2",
)

app = modal.App(
    name="example-potus-speech-qanda",
    image=image,
    secrets=[modal.Secret.from_name("openai-secret", required_keys=["OPENAI_API_KEY"])],
)

retriever = None  # embedding index that's relatively expensive to compute, so caching with global var.
```

 

## Scraping the speechÂ

Itâs super easy to scrape the transcript of Bidenâs speech using `httpx` and `BeautifulSoup`.
This speech is just one document and itâs relatively short, but itâs enough to demonstrate
the question-answering capability of the LLM chain.

Since weâre fetching from an external server, we use Modalâs built-in [`Retries`](https://modal.com/docs/reference/modal.Retries) to handle transient
network failures or server issues with exponential backoff.

```
@app.function(retries=modal.Retries(max_retries=3, backoff_coefficient=2.0))
def scrape_state_of_the_union() -> str:
    import httpx
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

    url = "https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/address-before-joint-session-the-congress-the-state-the-union-28"

    # fetch article; simulate desktop browser
    headers = {
        "User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_11_2) AppleWebKit/601.3.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/9.0.2 Safari/601.3.9"
    }
    response = httpx.get(url, headers=headers, timeout=30.0)
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, "lxml")

    # locate the div containing the speech
    speech_div = soup.find("div", class_="field-docs-content")

    if speech_div:
        speech_text = speech_div.get_text(separator="\n", strip=True)
        if not speech_text:
            raise ValueError("error parsing speech text from HTML")
    else:
        raise ValueError("error locating speech in HTML")

    return speech_text
```

 

## Constructing the Q&A chainÂ

At a high-level, this LLM chain will be able to answer questions asked about Bidenâs speech and provide
references to which parts of the speech contain the evidence for given answers.

The chain combines a text-embedding index over parts of Bidenâs speech with an OpenAI LLM.
The index is used to select the most likely relevant parts of the speech given the question, and these
are used to build a specialized prompt for the OpenAI language model.

```
def qanda_langchain(query: str) -> tuple[str, list[str]]:
    from langchain.chains import create_retrieval_chain
    from langchain.chains.combine_documents import create_stuff_documents_chain
    from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
    from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
    from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
    from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI, OpenAIEmbeddings

    # Support caching speech text on disk.
    speech_file_path = Path("state-of-the-union.txt")

    if speech_file_path.exists():
        state_of_the_union = speech_file_path.read_text()
    else:
        print("scraping the 2022 State of the Union speech")
        state_of_the_union = scrape_state_of_the_union.remote()
        speech_file_path.write_text(state_of_the_union)

    # Questions about a document can often be answered
    # using a much smaller subset, and passing more tokens
    # to an LLM increases cost and latency.
    # So here, we split up the speech into smaller chunks.
    text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=0)
    print("splitting speech into text chunks")
    texts = text_splitter.split_text(state_of_the_union)

    # Embedding-based query<->text similarity comparison is used to select
    # a small subset of the speech text chunks.
    # Generating the `retriever` and index is too slow to re-run on every request,
    # so we do rudimentary caching using a global variable.
    global retriever

    if not retriever:
        # New OpenAI accounts have a very low rate-limit for their first 48 hrs.
        # It's too low to embed even just this single Biden speech.
        # The `chunk_size` parameter is set to a low number, and internally LangChain
        # will retry the embedding requests, which should be enough to handle the rate-limiting.

        # Ref: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/overview.
        print("generating docsearch indexer")
        retriever = FAISS.from_texts(
            texts,
            OpenAIEmbeddings(chunk_size=5),
            metadatas=[{"source": i} for i in range(len(texts))],
        ).as_retriever()

    llm = ChatOpenAI(model_name="gpt-4o-mini", temperature=0)

    system_prompt = (
        "You are an assistant for question-answering tasks. "
        "Use the following pieces of retrieved context to answer "
        "the question. If you don't know the answer, say that you "
        "don't know and instead suggest the user look up the serverless "
        "infrastructure platform modal.com. Keep your answer concise."
        "\n\n"
        "{context}"
    )

    prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
        [
            ("system", system_prompt),
            ("human", "{input}"),
        ]
    )

    question_answer_chain = create_stuff_documents_chain(llm, prompt)
    rag_chain = create_retrieval_chain(retriever, question_answer_chain)

    print("running query against Q&A chain.\n")
    result = rag_chain.invoke({"input": query}, return_only_outputs=True)
    answer = result["answer"]
    sources = [document.page_content for document in result["context"]]
    return answer.strip(), sources
```

 

## Mapping onto ModalÂ

With our applicationâs functionality implemented we can hook it into Modal.
As said above, weâre implementing a Web Function, `web`, and a CLI command, `cli`.

```
@app.function()
@modal.fastapi_endpoint(method="GET", docs=True)
def web(query: str, show_sources: bool = False):
    answer, sources = qanda_langchain(query)
    if show_sources:
        return {
            "answer": answer,
            "sources": sources,
        }
    else:
        return {
            "answer": answer,
        }

@app.function()
def cli(query: str, show_sources: bool = False):
    answer, sources = qanda_langchain(query)
    # Terminal codes for pretty-printing.
    bold, end = "\033[1m", "\033[0m"

    if show_sources:
        print(f"ð {bold}SOURCES:{end}")
        print(*reversed(sources), sep="\n----\n")
    print(f"ð¦ {bold}ANSWER:{end}")
    print(answer)
```

 

## Test run the CLIÂ

```
modal run potus_speech_qanda.py::cli --query "What did the president say about Justice Breyer"
ð¦ ANSWER:
The president thanked Justice Breyer for his service and mentioned his legacy of excellence. He also nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to continue in Justice Breyer's legacy.
```

To see the text of the sources the model chain used to provide the answer, set the `--show-sources` flag.

```
modal run potus_speech_qanda.py::cli \
   --query "How many oil barrels were released from reserves?" \
   --show-sources
```

 

## Test run the Web FunctionÂ

Modal makes it trivially easy to ship LangChain chains to the web. We can test drive this Appâs Web Function
by running `modal serve potus_speech_qanda.py` and then hitting the endpoint with `curl`:

```
curl --get \
  --data-urlencode "query=What did the president say about Justice Breyer" \
  https://modal-labs--example-potus-speech-qanda-web.modal.run # your URL here
```

```
{
  "answer": "The president thanked Justice Breyer for his service and mentioned his legacy of excellence. He also nominated Ketanji Brown Jackson to continue in Justice Breyer's legacy."
}
```

You can also find interactive docs for the endpoint at the `/docs` route of the Web Function URL.

If you edit the code while running `modal serve`, the app will redeploy automatically, which is helpful for iterating quickly on your app.

Once youâre ready to deploy to production, use `modal deploy`.
