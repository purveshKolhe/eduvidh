# modal.Image

```
class Image(modal.object.Object)
```

Base class for container images to run functions in.

Do not construct this class directly; instead use one of its static factory methods,
such as `modal.Image.debian_slim`, `modal.Image.from_registry`, or `modal.Image.micromamba`.

## add\_local\_fileÂ

```
add_local_file(self, local_path, remote_path, *, copy=False)
```

Adds a local file to the image at `remote_path` within the container.

By default (`copy=False`), the files are added to containers on startup and are not built into the actual Image,
which speeds up deployment.

Set `copy=True` to copy the files into an Image layer at build time instead, similar to how [`COPY`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) works in a `Dockerfile`.

copy=True can slow down iteration since it requires a rebuild of the Image and any subsequent
build steps whenever the included files change, but it is required if you want to run additional
build steps after this one.

*Added in v0.66.40*: This method replaces the deprecated `modal.Image.copy_local_file` method.

**Parameters**

local\_path str | Path

Path to the file on the local machine.

remote\_path str

Absolute path inside the container where the file should appear.

copy bool

If True, bake the file into an image layer at build time; if False, mount at container startup. (Default is False)

**Returns**

A new `Image` with the file layer or mount applied.

## add\_local\_dirÂ

```
add_local_dir(self, local_path, remote_path, *, copy=False, ignore=[])
```

Adds a local directoryâs content to the image at `remote_path` within the container.

By default (`copy=False`), the files are added to containers on startup and are not built into the actual Image,
which speeds up deployment.

Set `copy=True` to copy the files into an Image layer at build time instead, similar to how [`COPY`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) works in a `Dockerfile`.

copy=True can slow down iteration since it requires a rebuild of the Image and any subsequent
build steps whenever the included files change, but it is required if you want to run additional
build steps after this one.

*Added in v0.66.40*: This method replaces the deprecated `modal.Image.copy_local_dir` method.

**Parameters**

local\_path str | Path

Path to the directory on the local machine.

remote\_path str

Absolute path inside the container where the directory contents should appear.

copy bool

If True, bake the tree into an image layer at build time; if False, mount at container startup. (Default is False)

ignore Sequence[str] | Callable[[Path], bool]

Predicate or pattern list for file exclusion (True means exclude). A sequence is converted to a dockerignore-style matcher. (Default is [])

**Returns**

A new `Image` with the directory layer or mount applied.

**Usage**

```
from modal import FilePatternMatcher

image = modal.Image.debian_slim().add_local_dir(
    "~/assets",
    remote_path="/assets",
    ignore=["*.venv"],
)

image = modal.Image.debian_slim().add_local_dir(
    "~/assets",
    remote_path="/assets",
    ignore=lambda p: p.is_relative_to(".venv"),
)

image = modal.Image.debian_slim().add_local_dir(
    "~/assets",
    remote_path="/assets",
    ignore=FilePatternMatcher("**/*.txt"),
)

# When including files is simpler than excluding them, you can use the `~` operator to invert the matcher.
image = modal.Image.debian_slim().add_local_dir(
    "~/assets",
    remote_path="/assets",
    ignore=~FilePatternMatcher("**/*.py"),
)

# You can also read ignore patterns from a file.
image = modal.Image.debian_slim().add_local_dir(
    "~/assets",
    remote_path="/assets",
    ignore=FilePatternMatcher.from_file("/path/to/ignorefile"),
)
```

 

## add\_local\_python\_sourceÂ

```
add_local_python_source(self, *modules, copy=False, ignore=NON_PYTHON_FILES)
```

Adds locally available Python packages/modules to containers.

Adds all files from the specified Python package or module to containers running the Image.

Packages are added to the `/root` directory of containers, which is on the `PYTHONPATH` of any executed Modal Functions, enabling import of the module by that name.

By default (`copy=False`), the files are added to containers on startup and are not built into the actual Image,
which speeds up deployment.

Set `copy=True` to copy the files into an Image layer at build time instead. This can slow down iteration since
it requires a rebuild of the Image and any subsequent build steps whenever the included files change, but it is
required if you want to run additional build steps after this one.

**Note:** This excludes all dot-prefixed subdirectories or files and all `.pyc`/`__pycache__` files.
To add full directories with finer control, use `.add_local_dir()` instead and specify `/root` as
the destination directory.

By default only includes `.py`-files in the source modules. Set the `ignore` argument to a list of patterns
or a callable to override this behavior.

*Added in v0.67.28*: This method replaces the deprecated `modal.Mount.from_local_python_packages` pattern.

**Parameters**

\*modules str

Python package or module names to include from the local project.

copy bool

If True, bake sources into an image layer; if False, mount at container startup. (Default is False)

ignore Sequence[str] | Callable[[Path], bool]

Patterns or callable controlling which files to exclude. (Default is NON\_PYTHON\_FILES)

**Returns**

A new `Image` with the Python source mount or layer applied.

**Usage**

```
# includes everything except data.json
modal.Image.debian_slim().add_local_python_source("mymodule", ignore=["data.json"])

# exclude large files
modal.Image.debian_slim().add_local_python_source(
    "mymodule",
    ignore=lambda p: p.stat().st_size > 1e9
)
```

 

## from\_idÂ

```
from_id(cls, image_id, client=None)
```

Construct an Image from an id and look up the Image result.

The ID of an Image object can be accessed using `.object_id`.

**Parameters**

image\_id str

Image object ID to load.

client "modal.client.Client | None"

Optional Modal client; uses the default synchronizer client when omitted.

**Returns**

A hydrated `Image` handle for the given ID.

## buildÂ

```
build(self, app)
```

Eagerly build an image.

If your image was previously built, then this method will not rebuild your image
and your cached image is returned.

For defining Modal functions, images are built automatically when deploying or running an App.
You do not need to build the image explicitly in that case.

**Parameters**

app modal.app.\_App

Initialized app used as the load context for the image build.

**Returns**

This image after the build (and resolver load) completes.

**Usage**

```
image = modal.Image.debian_slim().uv_pip_install("scipy", "numpy")

app = modal.App.lookup("build-image", create_if_missing=True)
with modal.enable_output():  # To see logs in your local terminal
    image.build(app)

# Save the image id
my_image_id = image.object_id

# Reference the image with the id or uses it another context.
built_image = modal.Image.from_id(my_image_id)
```

Alternatively, you can pre-build an image and use it in a sandbox:

```
app = modal.App.lookup("sandbox-example", create_if_missing=True)

with modal.enable_output():
    image = modal.Image.debian_slim().uv_pip_install("scipy")
    image.build(app)

sb = modal.Sandbox.create("python", "-c", "import scipy; print(scipy)", app=app, image=image)
print(sb.stdout.read())
sb.terminate()
```

```
app = modal.App()
image = modal.Image.debian_slim()

# No need to explicitly build the image for defining a function.
@app.function(image=image)
def f():
    ...
```

    poetry_version="latest", old_installer=False, env=None, secrets=None,
    gpu=None)
```

Install poetry *dependencies* specified by a local `pyproject.toml` file.

If not provided as argument the path to the lockfile is inferred. However, the
file has to exist, unless `ignore_lockfile` is set to `True`.

Note that the root project of the poetry project is not installed, only the dependencies.
For including local python source files see `add_local_python_source`

Poetry will be installed to the Image (using pip) unless `poetry_version` is set to None.
Note that the interpretation of `poetry_version="latest"` depends on the Modal Image Builder
version, with versions 2024.10 and earlier limiting poetry to 1.x.

**Parameters**

poetry\_pyproject\_toml str

Path to a Poetry `pyproject.toml` file.

poetry\_lockfile str | None

Path to `poetry.lock`; if omitted, inferred next to the pyproject.

If True, use Poetry's legacy installer. (Default is False)

env dict[str, str | None] | None

Environment variables set in the build container.

secrets Collection[\_Secret] | None

Secrets injected as environment variables during the build.

gpu str | None

GPU type to attach to the builder container.

**Returns**

A new `Image` with Poetry dependencies installed.

## uv\_syncÂ

```
uv_sync(self, uv_project_dir="./", *, force_build=False, groups=None,
    extras=None, frozen=True, extra_options="", uv_version=None, env=None,
    secrets=None, gpu=None)
```

Creates a virtual environment with the dependencies in a uv managed project with `uv sync`.

The `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` in `uv_project_dir` are automatically added to the build context. The `uv_project_dir` is relative to the current working directory of where `modal` is called.

NOTE: This does *not* install the project itself into the environment (this is equivalent to the `--no-install-project` flag in the `uv sync` command) and you would be expected to add any local python source
files using `Image.add_local_python_source` or similar methods after this call.

This ensures that updates to your project code wouldnât require reinstalling third-party dependencies
after every change.

uv workspaces are currently not supported.

Added in v1.1.0.

**Parameters**

uv\_project\_dir str

Path to the local uv project directory (contains `pyproject.toml`). (Default is "./")

force\_build bool

If True, skip cached image builds. (Default is False)

groups list[str] | None

Dependency groups passed as `uv sync --group`.

extras list[str] | None

Optional extras passed as `uv sync --extra`.

frozen bool

If True and a `uv.lock` exists, run `uv sync --frozen` so the lock is not updated at build time. (Default is True)

extra\_options str

Additional raw options appended to `uv sync`. (Default is "")

uv\_version str | None

Pin the uv binary version copied from `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv`.

env dict[str, str | None] | None

Environment variables set in the build container.

secrets Collection[\_Secret] | None

Secrets injected as environment variables during the build.

gpu str | None

GPU type to attach to the builder container.

**Returns**

A new `Image` with a uv-managed virtual environment.

**Usage**

```
image = modal.Image.debian_slim().uv_sync()
```

## from\_registryÂ

```
from_registry(tag, secret=None, *, setup_dockerfile_commands=[],
    force_build=False, add_python=None, **kwargs)
```

Build a Modal Image from a public or private image registry, such as Docker Hub.

The image must be built for the `linux/amd64` platform.

If your image does not come with Python installed, you can use the `add_python` parameter
to specify a version of Python to add to the image. Otherwise, the image is expected to
have Python on PATH as `python`, along with `pip`.

You may also use `setup_dockerfile_commands` to run Dockerfile commands before the
remaining commands run. This might be useful if you want a custom Python installation or to
set a `SHELL`. Prefer `run_commands()` when possible though.

To authenticate against a private registry with static credentials, you must set the `secret` parameter to
a `modal.Secret` containing a username (`REGISTRY_USERNAME`) and
an access token or password (`REGISTRY_PASSWORD`).

To authenticate against private registries with credentials from a cloud provider,
use `Image.from_gcp_artifact_registry()` or `Image.from_aws_ecr()`.

**Parameters**

tag str

Registry image reference (e.g. `python:3.11-slim`).

secret \_Secret | None

Optional secret for static registry credentials.

setup\_dockerfile\_commands list[str]

Extra Dockerfile lines run after `FROM` during base setup. (Default is [])

force\_build bool

If True, skip cached image builds. (Default is False)

add\_python str | None

Optional standalone Python series to inject when the base image lacks Python.

\*\*kwargs

Additional arguments forwarded to the internal image constructor (e.g. registry config).

**Returns**

An `Image` based on the registry tag.

**Usage**

```
modal.Image.from_registry("python:3.11-slim-bookworm")
modal.Image.from_registry("ubuntu:22.04", add_python="3.11")

## from\_gcp\_artifact\_registryÂ

```
from_gcp_artifact_registry(tag, secret=None, *, setup_dockerfile_commands=[],
    force_build=False, add_python=None, **kwargs)
```

Build a Modal image from a private image in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Artifact Registry.

You will need to pass a `modal.Secret` containing [your GCP service account key data](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/keys-create-delete#creating) as `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`. This can be done from the [Secrets](https://modal.com/secrets) page.
Your service account should be granted a specific role depending on the GCP registry used:

* For Artifact Registry images (`pkg.dev` domains) use
  the [âArtifact Registry Readerâ](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/access-control#roles) role
* For Container Registry images (`gcr.io` domains) use
  the [âStorage Object Viewerâ](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/transition/setup-gcr-repo) role

**Note:** This method does not use `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` as that
variable accepts a path to a JSON file, not the actual JSON string.

See `Image.from_registry()` for information about the other parameters.

**Parameters**

tag str

Full GCP Artifact Registry image reference.

secret \_Secret | None

Secret containing `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON` for registry authentication.

setup\_dockerfile\_commands list[str]

Extra Dockerfile lines run after `FROM` during base setup. (Default is [])

force\_build bool

If True, skip cached image builds. (Default is False)

add\_python str | None

Optional standalone Python series to inject when the base image lacks Python.

\*\*kwargs

Additional arguments forwarded to `from_registry`.

**Returns**

An `Image` based on the private GCP artifact.

**Usage**

```
modal.Image.from_gcp_artifact_registry(
    "us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/my-project-1234/my-repo/my-image:my-version",
    secret=modal.Secret.from_name(
        "my-gcp-secret",
        required_keys=["SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON"],
    ),
    add_python="3.11",
)
```

 

## from\_aws\_ecrÂ

```
from_aws_ecr(tag, secret=None, *, setup_dockerfile_commands=[],
    force_build=False, add_python=None, **kwargs)
```

Build a Modal image from a private image in AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

You will need to pass a `modal.Secret` containing either IAM user credentials or OIDC
configuration to access the target ECR registry.

For IAM user authentication, set `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION`.

For OIDC authentication, set `AWS_ROLE_ARN` and `AWS_REGION`.

IAM configuration details can be found in the AWS documentation for [âPrivate repository policiesâ](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-policies.html).

For more details on using an AWS role to access ECR, see the [OIDC integration guide](https://modal.com/docs/guide/oidc-integration).

See `Image.from_registry()` for information about the other parameters.

**Parameters**

tag str

Full ECR image URI.

secret \_Secret | None

Secret with IAM or OIDC credentials for ECR.

setup\_dockerfile\_commands list[str]

Extra Dockerfile lines run after `FROM` during base setup. (Default is [])

force\_build bool

If True, skip cached image builds. (Default is False)

add\_python str | None

Optional standalone Python series to inject when the base image lacks Python.

\*\*kwargs

Additional arguments forwarded to `from_registry`.

**Returns**

An `Image` based on the private ECR image.

**Usage**

```
modal.Image.from_aws_ecr(
    "000000000000.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/my-private-registry:my-version",
    secret=modal.Secret.from_name(
        "aws",
        required_keys=["AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID", "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY", "AWS_REGION"],
    ),
    add_python="3.11",
)
```

 

## from\_dockerfileÂ

```
from_dockerfile(path, *, force_build=False, context_dir=None, env=None,
    secrets=None, gpu=None, add_python=None, build_args={},
    ignore=AUTO_DOCKERIGNORE)
```

Build a Modal image from a local Dockerfile.

**Returns**

An `Image` built from the Dockerfile plus Modal runtime dependencies.

**Usage**

```
from modal import FilePatternMatcher

# By default a .dockerignore file is used if present in the current working directory
image = modal.Image.from_dockerfile(
    "./Dockerfile",
    add_python="3.12",
)

image = modal.Image.from_dockerfile(
    "./Dockerfile",
    add_python="3.12",
    ignore=["*.venv"],
)

image = modal.Image.from_dockerfile(
    "./Dockerfile",
    add_python="3.12",
    ignore=lambda p: p.is_relative_to(".venv"),
)

image = modal.Image.from_dockerfile(
    "./Dockerfile",
    add_python="3.12",
    ignore=FilePatternMatcher("**/*.txt"),
)

# When including files is simpler than excluding them, you can use the `~` operator to invert the matcher.
image = modal.Image.from_dockerfile(
    "./Dockerfile",
    add_python="3.12",
    ignore=~FilePatternMatcher("**/*.py"),
)

# You can also read ignore patterns from a file.
image = modal.Image.from_dockerfile(
    "./Dockerfile",
    add_python="3.12",
    ignore=FilePatternMatcher.from_file("/path/to/dockerignore"),
)
```

 

## from\_scratchÂ

```
from_scratch(force_build=False)
```

Create an empty Image, equivalent to `FROM scratch` in Docker.

The resulting Image has no operating system, shell, or package manager. It is
primarily useful as a lightweight filesystem to mount into a Sandbox via `Sandbox.mount_image`.

Note that since this Image doesnât contain Python or other standard OS utilities,
higher-level Image build steps like `pip_install` cannot be chained onto it. It also
cannot be used for `modal.Function` execution, which requires a Python interpreter.

**Parameters**

force\_build bool

If True, skip cached image builds. (Default is False)

**Returns**

An empty `Image` suitable for minimal filesystem mounts.

**Usage**

```
image = modal.Image.from_scratch().add_local_file(local_path, "/bin/my_binary", copy=True)
```

 

## debian\_slimÂ

```
debian_slim(python_version=None, force_build=False)
```

Default image, based on the official `python` Docker images.

**Parameters**

python\_version str | None

Python series or full version to use from the Debian slim images.

force\_build bool

If True, skip cached image builds. (Default is False)

**Returns**

The standard Debian slim Python `Image` used as Modalâs default base.

## apt\_installÂ

```
apt_install(self, *packages, force_build=False, env=None, secrets=None,
    gpu=None)
```

Install a list of Debian packages using `apt`.

**Parameters**

\*packages str | list[str]

Apt package names to install, e.g. `git` or `libpq-dev`.

force\_build bool

If True, skip cached image builds. (Default is False)

env dict[str, str | None] | None

Environment variables set in the build container.

secrets Collection[\_Secret] | None

Secrets injected as environment variables during the build.

gpu str | None

GPU type to attach to the builder container.

**Returns**

A new `Image` with `apt-get install` layers applied.

**Usage**

```
image = modal.Image.debian_slim().apt_install("git")
```

 

## run\_functionÂ

```
run_function(self, raw_f, *, env=None, secrets=None, volumes={},
    network_file_systems={}, gpu=None, cpu=None, memory=None, timeout=60 * 60,
    cloud=None, region=None, force_build=False, args=(), kwargs={},
    include_source=True)
```

Run user-defined function `raw_f` as an image build step.

The function runs like an ordinary Modal Function, accepting a resource configuration and integrating
with Modal features like Secrets and Volumes. Unlike ordinary Modal Functions, any changes to the
filesystem state will be captured on container exit and saved as a new Image.

Only the source code of `raw_f`, the contents of `**kwargs`, and any referenced *global* variables
are used to determine whether the image has changed and needs to be rebuilt.
If this function references other functions or variables, the image will not be rebuilt if you
make changes to them. You can force a rebuild by changing the functionâs source code itself.

**Parameters**

raw\_f Callable[..., Any]

Callable executed remotely during the image build.

env dict[str, str | None] | None

Environment variables set in the builder container.

secrets Collection[\_Secret] | None

Secrets available to the builder function.

volumes dict[str | PurePosixPath, \_Volume | \_CloudBucketMount]

Volume and bucket mounts attached for the build. (Default is {})

network\_file\_systems dict[str | PurePosixPath, \_NetworkFileSystem]

Network file systems attached for the build. (Default is {})

gpu str | list[str] | None

GPU type or list of types for the builder container.

cpu float | None

CPU cores to request (soft limit).

memory int | None

Memory to request in MiB (soft limit).

timeout int

Maximum build-step runtime in seconds. (Default is 60 \* 60)

cloud str | None

Cloud provider for the builder function.

region str | Sequence[str] | None

Region or regions for the builder function.

force\_build bool

If True, skip cached image builds. (Default is False)

args Sequence[Any]

Positional arguments serialized to the builder function. (Default is ())

kwargs dict[str, Any]

Keyword arguments serialized to the builder function. (Default is {})

include\_source bool

Whether to include the function's source in the builder image. (Default is True)

**Returns**

A new `Image` capturing the filesystem after `raw_f` completes.

**Usage**

```
def my_build_function():
    open("model.pt", "w").write("parameters!")

image = (
    modal.Image
        .debian_slim()
        .pip_install("torch")
        .run_function(my_build_function, secrets=[...], volumes={...})
)
```

 

## envÂ

```
env(self, vars)
```

Sets the environment variables in an Image.

**Parameters**

vars dict[str, str]

Map of environment variable names to string values.

**Returns**

A new `Image` with `ENV` directives applied.

**Usage**

```
image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim()
    .env({"HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER": "1"})
)
```

 

## workdirÂ

```
workdir(self, path)
```

Set the working directory for subsequent image build steps and function execution.

**Parameters**

path str | PurePosixPath

Working directory path inside the image.

**Returns**

A new `Image` with `WORKDIR` applied.

**Usage**

```
image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim()
    .run_commands("git clone https://xyz app")
    .workdir("/app")
    .run_commands("yarn install")
)
```

 

## cmdÂ

```
cmd(self, cmd)
```

Set the default command (`CMD`) to run when a container is started.

Used with `modal.Sandbox`. Has no effect on `modal.Function`.

**Parameters**

cmd list[str]

argv tokens for the default container command.

**Returns**

A new `Image` with `CMD` applied.

**Usage**

```
image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim().cmd(["python", "app.py"])
)
```

 

## pipeÂ

```
pipe(self, func, *args, **kwargs)
```

Apply a local function to expand the Image recipe.

This method can be useful for defining reusable Image build
recipes that compose well with the fluent Image builder interface.

**Example**

```
def workspace_setup(image: modal.Image, repo: str) -> modal.Image:
    return image.run_commands(f"git clone {repo}").uv_pip_install(".")

image = (
    modal.Image.debian_slim()
    .apt_install("git")
    .pipe(workspace_setup, "https://github.com/example/repo.git")
)
```

 

## importsÂ

```
imports(self)
```

Used to import packages in global scope that are only available when running remotely.

By using this context manager you can avoid an `ImportError` due to not having certain
packages installed locally.

**Returns**

Context manager that records import failures until the image is hydrated in the remote environment.

**Usage**

```
with image.imports():
    import torch
```

 

## from\_nameÂ

```
from_name(name, *, environment_name=None, client=None)
```

Reference a named Image that was previously published with `.publish()`.

Names can contain an optional `:tag` part - if no tag part is included `":latest"` is used,
matching Docker conventions.

```
image = modal.Image.from_name("my-image")     # references my-image:latest
image_v1 = modal.Image.from_name("my-image:v1")

@app.function(image=image)
def run():
    ...
```

 

## publishÂ

```
publish(self, name, *, environment_name=None, client=None)
```

Publish this image under the given name

The Image must already be created (typically by calling `image.build()` or `sandbox.snapshot_filesystem()`).

Image names can contain an explicit tag designation (using the `name:tag`). If no tag is included in the name, `":latest"` is used, matching Docker conventions. To publish multiple tags, call `.publish()` once per tag.

```
image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install("numpy")
image.build(app)
image.publish("my-image-with-numpy")     # my-image-with-numpy:latest
image.publish("my-image-with-numpy:v1")
```
