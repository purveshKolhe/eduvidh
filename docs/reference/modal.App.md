# modal.App

```
class App(object)
```

A Modal App is a group of functions and classes that are deployed together.

The app serves at least three purposes:

* A unit of deployment for functions and classes.
* Syncing of identities of (primarily) functions and classes across processes
  (your local Python interpreter and every Modal container active in your application).
* Manage log collection for everything that happens inside your code.

**Registering functions with an app**

The most common way to explicitly register an Object with an app is through the `@app.function()` decorator. It both registers the annotated function itself and
other passed objects, like schedules and secrets, with the app:

```
import modal

app = modal.App()

@app.function(
    secrets=[modal.Secret.from_name("some_secret")],
    schedule=modal.Period(days=1),
)
def foo():
    pass
```

In this example, the secret and schedule are registered with the app.

```
__init__(self, name=None, *, tags=None, image=None, secrets=[], volumes={},
    include_source=True)
```

Construct a new app, optionally with default image, mounts, secrets, or volumes.

**Parameters**

name str | None

Optional app name used for registration and lookup.

tags dict[str, str] | None

Additional metadata to set on the App.

image \_Image | None

Default image for the App (otherwise defaults to `modal.Image.debian_slim()`).

secrets Sequence[\_Secret]

Secrets to add for all Functions in the App. (Default is [])

volumes dict[str | PurePosixPath, \_Volume]

Volume mounts to use for all Functions. (Default is {})

include\_source bool

Default for whether Function source files are added to the Modal container (per-function override possible). (Default is True)

**Usage**

```
image = modal.Image.debian_slim().pip_install(...)
secret = modal.Secret.from_name("my-secret")
volume = modal.Volume.from_name("my-data")
app = modal.App(image=image, secrets=[secret], volumes={"/mnt/data": volume})
```

 

## nameÂ

```
name(self)
```

The user-provided name of the App.

**Returns**

The configured app name, if any.

## app\_idÂ

```
app_id(self)
```

Return the app\_id of a running or stopped app.

**Returns**

The app ID when the app has been deployed or run, otherwise None.

## descriptionÂ

```
description(self)
```

The Appâs `name`, if available, or a fallback descriptive identifier.

**Returns**

Human-readable description string for the app.

## lookupÂ

```
lookup(name, *, client=None, environment_name=None, create_if_missing=False)
```

Look up an App with a given name, creating a new App if necessary.

Note that Apps created through this method will be in a deployed state,
but they will not have any associated Functions or Classes. This method
is mainly useful for creating an App to associate with a Sandbox.

**Parameters**

name str

App name to resolve or create.

client \_Client | None

Modal client to use; defaults to `Client.from_env()` when omitted.

environment\_name str | None

Optional environment name; defaults to the configured environment.

create\_if\_missing bool

If True, create the app when it does not already exist. (Default is False)

**Returns**

An `App` handle tied to the deployed app record.

**Usage**

```
app = modal.App.lookup("my-app", create_if_missing=True)
modal.Sandbox.create("echo", "hi", app=app)
```

 

## get\_dashboard\_urlÂ

```
get_dashboard_url(self)
```

Get the dashboard URL for the App.

**Returns**

The dashboard URL for the App.

**Usage**

```
app = modal.App.lookup("my-app")
print(app.get_dashboard_url())
```

 

## runÂ

```
run(self, *, name=None, client=None, detach=False, interactive=False,
    environment_name=None)
```

Context manager that runs an ephemeral app on Modal.

Use this as the main entry point for your Modal application. All calls
to Modal Functions should be made within the scope of this context
manager, and they will correspond to the current App.

Note that you should not invoke this in global scope of a file where you have
Modal Functions or Classes defined, since that would run the block when the Function
or Cls is imported in your containers as well. If you want to run it as your entrypoint,
consider protecting it with `if __name__ == "__main__"`.

**Parameters**

client \_Client | None

Modal client to use for the run session.

detach bool

Whether to detach after starting the app. (Default is False)

interactive bool

Whether to run in interactive mode. (Default is False)

environment\_name str | None

Optional environment name; defaults to the configured environment.

**Returns**

Async context manager yielding this `App` while it is running.

**Usage**

```
with app.run():
    some_modal_function.remote()
```

To enable output printing (i.e., to see App logs), use `modal.enable_output()`:

```
with modal.enable_output():
    with app.run():
        some_modal_function.remote()
```

Note that you should not invoke this in global scope of a file where you have Modal
Functions or Classes defined, since that would run the block when the Function or Cls
is imported in your containers as well. If you want to run it as your entrypoint,
consider protecting it:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with app.run():
        some_modal_function.remote()
```

You can then run your script with:

```
python app_module.py
```

 

## deployÂ

```
deploy(self, *, name=None, environment_name=None, tag="", client=None,
    strategy="rolling")
```

Deploy the App so that it is available persistently.

Deployed Apps will be available for lookup or web-based invocations until they are stopped.
Unlike with `App.run`, this method will return as soon as the deployment completes.

This method is a programmatic alternative to the `modal deploy` CLI command.

Unlike with `App.run`, Function logs will not stream back to the local client after the
App is deployed.

Note that you should not invoke this method in global scope, as that would redeploy
the App every time the file is imported. If you want to write a programmatic deployment
script, protect this call so that it only runs when the file is executed directly.

**Parameters**

name str | None

Name for the deployment, overriding any set on the App.

environment\_name str | None

Environment to deploy the App in.

tag str

Optional metadata that is specific to this deployment. (Default is "")

client \_Client | None

Alternate client to use for communication with the server.

strategy str

Deployment strategy. `rolling` (default) shifts traffic gradually to new containers while old ones drain. `recreate` terminates all running containers as part of the deployment before new work starts. (Default is "rolling")

**Returns**

This app instance after deployment completes.

**Usage**

```
app = App("my-app")
app.deploy()
```

To enable output printing (i.e., to see build logs), use `modal.enable_output()`:

```
app = App("my-app")
with modal.enable_output():
    app.deploy()
```

Unlike with `App.run`, Function logs will not stream back to the local client after the App is deployed.

Note that you should not invoke this method in global scope, as that would redeploy the App every time
the file is imported. If you want to write a programmatic deployment script, protect this call so that it
only runs when the file is executed directly. You can then run your script with:

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with modal.enable_output():
        app.deploy()
```

Then you can deploy your app with:

```
python app_module.py
```

 

## local\_entrypointÂ

```
local_entrypoint(self, _warn_parentheses_missing=None, *, name=None)
```

Decorate a function to be used as a CLI entrypoint for a Modal App.

These functions can be used to define code that runs locally to set up the app,
and act as an entrypoint to start Modal functions from. Note that regular
Modal functions can also be used as CLI entrypoints, but unlike `local_entrypoint`,
those functions are executed remotely directly.

Note that an explicit [`app.run()`](https://modal.com/docs/sdk/py/latest/modal.App#run) is not needed, as an [app](https://modal.com/docs/guide/apps) is automatically created for you.

**Parameters**

name str | None

Optional name for the entrypoint; defaults to the function's qualified name.

**Returns**

A decorator that registers the wrapped callable as a local CLI entrypoint.

**Usage**

```
@app.local_entrypoint()
def main():
    some_modal_function.remote()
```

You can call the function using `modal run` directly from the CLI:

```
modal run app_module.py
```

Note that an explicit `app.run()` is not needed, as an app is automatically created for you.

**Multiple entrypoints**

If you have multiple `local_entrypoint` functions, qualify the name:

```
modal run app_module.py::app.some_other_function
```

**Parsing arguments**

If your entrypoint function take arguments with primitive types, `modal run` automatically
parses them as CLI options. For example, the following function can be called with `modal run app_module.py --foo 1 --bar "hello"`:

```
@app.local_entrypoint()
def main(foo: int, bar: str):
    some_modal_function.call(foo, bar)
```

Currently, `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `datetime.datetime` are supported.
Use `modal run app_module.py --help` for more information on usage.

```

 

## includeÂ

```
include(self, /, other_app, inherit_tags=True)
```

Include another Appâs objects in this one.

Useful for splitting up Modal Apps across different self-contained files.

When `inherit_tags=True` any tags set on the other App will be inherited by this App
(with this Appâs tags taking precedence in the case of conflicts).

**Parameters**

Any tags set on the App before calling this method will be removed if they are not
included in the argument (i.e., this method does not have `.update()` semantics).

**Parameters**

tags Mapping[str, str]

Complete tag set to store on the app (replaces previous tags).

client \_Client | None

Modal client to use for the RPC.

 

## get\_tagsÂ

```
